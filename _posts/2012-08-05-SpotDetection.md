title: Multi-Waveband Spot Detection with Solar Glint Suppression
---
White paper published in the Military Sensor Symposium Parallel Conference 2012.

Spot detection with solar glint suppression is the ability to recognize a small, bright target in an image while suppressing false alarms caused by solar glint.  This paper focuses on algorithm performance and gives an overview of possible applications, a discussion of algorithms and image processing techniques, a description of test data and data collections, and an analysis of algorithm results
